Hello World!

The creation of this blog marks the end of an era. An era which will be known to man as one of the longest. A winter that never had an end in sight!

Talking about the time I was procrastinating making my own Jekyll blog ofcourse.

{% highlight bash %}
wget https://github.com/grubdragon/lanyon/archive/v1.0.0.zip 
unzip v1.0.0.zip
mv lanyon-1.0.0 grubdragon.github.io
cd grubdragon.github.io
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Init"
git apply ../fixes.patch
git apply ../customizations.patch
git remote add origin https://github.com/grubdragon/grubdragon.github.io.git
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

That should've been simple shouldn't it? Hrrrmmmmmmm.
