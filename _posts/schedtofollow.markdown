A schedule to follow

Hello World! (Such fake much pretense wow)

So its summertime again. That time of the year, which can be wasted as well as it can used. I have constantly been making efforts to do some stuff.

## Bloody HEAT
The weather has NOT been flattering. I repeat. NOT. FLATTERING. The heat is getting too damn hard to bear. Days are real sweaty and the nights warm. Humidity levels have reached 99%. Everybody prays for rain. Press 'f' to pay respects.

## Nature Walk
So being in IIT Bombay has its perks, if you are a nature enthusiast. Since the start of this summer, I have been trying to maintain a sched, which starts with a morning walk(its a jog, but my damn stamina ends it with a walk).
