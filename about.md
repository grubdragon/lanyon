Hello there! :)

I'm Aryan Agal, a sophomore of Energy Science, IIT Bombay. I am a big time coding enthusiast and I revere concepts of computer science in general. I love listening to music (progressive a little psychedelic and post-progressive rock) and playing basketball, although I haven't been giving it much time these days.

I am always in the "There's a lot to do but no time to do it in" mode which often means I'm either flooded with too much work, or I'm simply trying to make myself look like it. I also take interest in Electronics and Robotics, and I've been part of the club as since my freshman year. I'm also a casual volunteer of the Web and Coding Club (tty10 <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

Catch me on <a href="http://facebook.com/aryan.agal.30"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> / <a href="http://github.com/grubdragon"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> / <a href="mailto:aryanagal98@gmail.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i></a> and drop me a line if you want to work with me on something, or just chat, I'd be happy to hear from you!

Also, if you're interested, here's a brief <a href="aryan_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Have questions/suggestions/fixes? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/grubdragon/grubdragon.github.io/issues/new) or [ask me on Facebook](http://facebook.com/aryan.agal.30).

Thanks for reading!
