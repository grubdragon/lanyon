Hello there! :)

I'm Aryan Agal, a Senior Undergrad majoring in Energy Science, IIT Bombay. I am a big time coding enthusiast and I revere concepts of computer science in general. I love listening to music (progressive a little psychedelic and post-progressive rock) and playing basketball, although I haven't been giving it much time these days.

Gradually I have realized that my interests lie in Applied math in Electrical Engineering. This means you can discuss Optimization, Deep Learning, Image Processing and Machine Learning with me. You know what? Feel free to discuss anything with me, I'm always looking to expand my horizons.

I also take interest in Electronics and Robotics, and I've been part of the club as since my freshman year. I'm also a casual volunteer of the Web and Coding Club (tty10 <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

Catch me on <a href="http://facebook.com/aryan.agal.30"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> / <a href="http://github.com/grubdragon"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> / <a href="mailto:aryanagal98@gmail.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i></a> and drop me a line if you want to work with me on something, or just chat, I'd be happy to hear from you!

Also, if you're interested, here's a brief <a href="aryan_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Have questions/suggestions/fixes? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/grubdragon/grubdragon.github.io/issues/new) or [ask me on Facebook](http://facebook.com/aryan.agal.30).

Thanks for reading!
